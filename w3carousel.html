  equation as a parameter to modify the value of whatever slideIndex is at

  are modifying the parameter of a function that hasn't been defined yet.
  the slideIndex still remains a parameter within the showSlides function. */

  /* showSlides is still holding the value of whatever slideIndex is but now
  you are going to use that parameter to do a few other things.
  1st thing you do within this function is define the dom? element that
  slides will be. then you put the guardrails on. then you select all slides
  in the array. they also display all slides within that array as display none
  but i'm not sure if they need to do this or not*  make sure you are using
  querySelectorAll this is also a little different. normally you would define
  a fucnction and then call it with a parameter. this time you are basically 
  defining the parameter and then defining the function. it's almost like you
  are calling the function showSlides with the dyanmic parameter first.
  
  then you call the function showSlides with whatever the parameter slideindex
  is. the slideIndex is always the important number though. with the 
  slides.[slideIndex-1] you are basically saying whatever number that is
  within the array display that object. 
  
  everything is all about this function showSlides. that's where everything is
  defined and it holds he value for the important parameter which has 
  an object in an array bound to it.  even when the machine that changes
  the variable slideIndex is pushed it is still defined as a parameter of
  the greater function  just by putting the slidesIndex number in the 
  array slot it automatically knows. which does make sense, since it's 
  essentially just a number. i dont know why if you type slides into the 
  console it comes back as undefined. when i did a console.log(slides) it 
  showed the NodeList*/
